# Jarx

Jarx makes running Java programs on Windows easy.

Java is platform-independent. Unfortunately, this means you can't start a Java program like any other program. You can start a Java program from the command line, from a batch-file or with a precisely contructed shortcut. You often have to set some environment variables, too. And when you upgrade your version of Java, everything breaks.

With Jarx, starting Java programs is easy. Your JAR files (Java Archive files with the .jar file extenstion) just behave like ordinary programs - just double click them to start them.
